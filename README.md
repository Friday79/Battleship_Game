## BattleshipsGame
This is a single-player Battleships game where the player tries to sink a certain number of ships placed randomly on a grid. The game offers feedback on whether a guess is a hit or a miss. The player wins when all ships are destroyed.

## How to Play

1. Start the game by entering the size of the grid (minimum size is 5x5).
2. The computer will randomly place a number of ships on the grid.
3. The player must guess the locations of the ships by entering row and column numbers.
4. The game will tell the player whether each guess is a "Hit!" or a "Miss!".
5. The objective is to sink all the ships by guessing their locations.
